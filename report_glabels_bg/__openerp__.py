        Extention of report using Glabels (http://glabels.org/). 
        GLabels is a GNU/Linux program for creating labels and business cards. 
        It is designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off label
        and business card sheets that youâ€™ll find at most office supply stores. 

        Glabels uses a template for the label design and are using a special
        notation, ${name}, for including fields from the database. When you
        design your labels use a dummy csv-file for your model you want 
        to tie the report to and the format "Text: coma separated Values
        (CSV) with keys on line 1". When the template is ready you can
        upload it to the report-record (or include it in the xml-record if
        you are building a module). There is a test report action that
        also lists all fields for the choosen model.
        
        This module needs Glabel to be installed on the server (for Ubuntu: 
        sudo apt install glabels)
        
        Test your template using glabels-batch-command:
        glabels-3-batch -o <out-file> -l -C -i <csv-file> <your template.glabels>
